# Project Objective
Wrangle and Store WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

# Wrangling
- The tweet archive was provided by Udacity and downloaded manually. Additional data queried from twitters API using
tweet ids present in the archive dataset, was downloaded manually and read line by line into a pandas dataframe. An
image prediction file from a neural network that classifies dog breeds contains a table of the top three image
predictions of dogs and was downloaded programmatically from Udacityâ€™s servers with the Requests library.

- To assess each dataset for errors, visual and programmatic assessment was carried out. Details of data wrangling steps can be found in this [wrangle report](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cda9ee1b-224c-34ff-8f49-e3131086f551) and in the wrangle_act notebook in this repository
